Random number generator seed: 1236669017278243862

Simulations of 3584 taxa, 768000 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Continuous gamma rate heterogeneity:
    shape = 5.000000
Model = GTR: General time reversible (nucleotides)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  rate matrix = gamma1: 0.2500 alpha1: 0.8200  beta1: 0.1500
                                beta2: 0.2700 alpha2: 2.9900
                                              gamma2:  1.0000
  with nucleotide frequencies specified as:
  A=0.299237 C=0.183687 G=0.196176 T=0.3209

Time taken: 356.87 seconds
